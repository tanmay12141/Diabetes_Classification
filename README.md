Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

This repository contains a dataset and code for predicting the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures.

## About the Dataset

The dataset used in this project is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It includes several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and more.
Context

The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. All patients in the dataset are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database.
